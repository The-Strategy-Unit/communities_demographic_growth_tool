We establish the rate of care per patient (attended contacts per patient) for patients who have been in contact with community services during the baseline year. We then project future community contacts, through to 2042/43, using the population growth expected by age, gender and geography (Local Authority).  

Population projections are for calendar years but NHS planning and commissioning cycles are usually based on financial years. Therefore, we estimated financial year population projections from calendar years. For each financial year, this allocated 75% of the population from the first calendar year and 25% of the population from the second calendar year. 

As the projection of community contacts was based on how the population was projected to change by age, gender and local authority, it was important not to duplicate patients where they may have appeared multiple times. For example, a patient with contacts both before and after their birthday would be counted twice under two ages â€“ falsely lowering the rate of care estimates. To counter this, for the factors of age and gender only one value was assigned to patient for the duration of the baseline year. For age, the age at first contact in 2022/23 was used.
