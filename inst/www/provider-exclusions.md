It is generally recognised that there are issues with CSDS data concerning the recording of attendance status (which was not mandatory before January 2023) and the regular submission of data. To minimise the impact of poor-quality data, a subset of providers were identified as having characteristics that would suggest they were of “consistent” quality. 

Providers were selected for inclusion in the “consistent” providers list if they had 12 submissions for 2022/23 (i.e. they submitted for every month of the year) as well as submitting contacts marked as attended in all 12 months of the year. This gave a list of 111 “consistent” providers, compared to 212 providers in the full data set. This smaller data set, whilst having just over half of the providers, did cover 79% of attended community contacts - 54,944,338 community contacts compared to 69,483,247 when using all providers. 

Since only the subset of community contacts from “consistent” providers are included in this tool absolute volumes of community contacts are undercounted. However, given the subset of data used here is large (79%), it can be viewed as a representative sample for England. This means that where measures are percentage-based (rather than absolute numbers) ICB and England projections are valid.
