The community services demographic growth tool provides projections for the volume of future community contacts necessary to keep up with demand due to population change over the coming decades.  

The projections shown relate solely to the pressures from population size and ageing. They do not account for other factors influencing demand for community contacts - such as left-shift from acute settings or changes to service provision within community services themselves. 

The tool was built by [The Strategy Unit](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/).
