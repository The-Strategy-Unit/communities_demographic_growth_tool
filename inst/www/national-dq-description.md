CSDS data is known to be under reported, and as a result, the absolute volumes of community services are undercounted.

Some providers of community care have been excluded from the analysis due to data quality issues. The table displays the volume of contacts excluded from the analysis, along with the reason for their exclusion.

Many of these relate to records with missing data, such as those where ICB, age or gender are missing and can’t be derived. Nationally, the volumes for these types of missing data items are small but this can vary by ICB. 

A larger exclusion is for those contacts where no attendance status is recorded. These records are excluded since it is not clear whether these contacts should be Attended, Cancelled or DNA’d.  

There can also be large exclusions where contacts are classed as ‘contact from an inconsistent provider’. The reasons and approach to this are described more fully in our About section under ‘Provider exclusions’. 

It is right to exclude community contacts where the patient was not actually seen (cancelled and DNA’d). However, for information, we also provide these volumes.
